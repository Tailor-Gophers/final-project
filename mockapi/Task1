1- Create a basic API framework with endpoints to handle the following capabilities: 
    -Get a list of different planes
    -Get the list of cities that exist as the origin or destination of flights.
    -Get a list of days on which a flight is defined

2- Implement an endpoint to get a list of flights from city A to city B on a specific day using the information obtained from Ticket 1.

3- Implement an endpoint to get more information about each flight by specifying the flight number using the information obtained from Ticket 1.

4- Add functionality to handle empty capacity of flights:
    -Modify the flight object to include empty capacity information.
    -Implement an endpoint to send a "reserve" message to reduce the empty capacity of the flight.
    -Implement an endpoint to send a "return" message to increase the flight capacity again.

5- Update the existing endpoints to reflect the changes made in Ticket 4.
